I honestly underestimated how much effort it is to keep a project alive. Especially when there are many moving parts involved. Having to keep up with SteamOS changes, Arch Linux changes, Decky Loader changes, and keeping up with issues that people encounter on a huge variety on different setups is something I hugely underestimated. I honestly should have wrote this a long time ago, but I always had the hope that maybe I come back to this project one day.

Please use the Fort from safijari. They also worked with me on this project originally and wrote huge parts of it!
